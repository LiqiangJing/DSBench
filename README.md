## Overview
DSBench is a benchmark for evaluating data science agents with 
realistic data analysis and data modeling tasks collected from 
modeloff and kaggle. 
Given a *task instruction (may contain image and table)* and
*data files*, a data science agent is tasked with generating 
a *solution* that resolves the described task.
