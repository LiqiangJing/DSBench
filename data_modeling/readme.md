# Data Modeling task


eval_code_interpreter.ipynb: A sample code to evaluate 
Code Interpreter with GPT series models on our data modeling task.

./output_model/gpt-3.5-turbo-0125: This is evaluation results of Code
Interpreter with gpt-3.5-turbo-0125. It recodes the cost, 
predicted answer, consuming time....

## How to evaluate CodeInterpreter on data modeling tasks
1. Unzip data.zip into the current path.
3. Set your OpenAI key in eval_code_interpreter.ipynb.
4. Run eval_code_interpreter.ipynb to evaluate the performance.
5. ```bash
   python score4each_com.py
   ```
    Computer the performance of the model on each competition with the corresponding metric, such as accuracy. Save the results in the directory `./save_performance/gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`.
7. ```bash
   python show_result.py
   ```
   Show the performance of the model based on the results generated from the last step.
