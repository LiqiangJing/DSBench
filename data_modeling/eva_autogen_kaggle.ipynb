      "The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n",

Inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones. \n",

While Porto Seguro has used machine learning for the past 20 years, they’re looking to Kaggle’s machine learning community to explore new, more powerful methods.

      "Can machine learning identify the appropriate reading level of a passage of text and help inspire learning? Reading is an essential skill for academic success. When students have access to engaging passages offering the right level of challenge, they naturally develop reading skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, most educational texts are matched to readers using traditional readability methods or commercially available formulas. However, each has its issues. Tools like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level are based on weak proxies of text decoding (i.e., characters or syllables per word) and syntactic complexity (i.e., number of words per sentence). As a result, they lack construct and theoretical validity. At the same time, commercially available formulas, such as Lexile, can be cost-prohibitive, lack suitable validation studies, and suffer from transparency issues when the formula's features aren't publicly available.\n",

      "In this competition, you’ll build algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, you'll pair your machine learning skills with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains. Winning models will be sure to incorporate text cohesion and semantics.\n",

      "If successful, you'll aid administrators, teachers, and students. Literacy curriculum developers and teachers who choose passages will be able to quickly and accurately evaluate works for their classrooms. Plus, these formulas will become more accessible for all.

Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed are explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.\n",

      "\n",
      "The goal of this competition is to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). Utilizing a dataset of essays written by ELLs will help to develop proficiency models that better support all students. Your work will help ELLs receive more accurate feedback on their language development and expedite the grading cycle for teachers. These outcomes could enable ELLs to receive more appropriate learning tasks that will help them improve their English language proficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing is a foundational skill. Sadly, it's one few students are able to hone, often because writing tasks are infrequently assigned in school. A rapidly growing student population, students learning English as a second language, known as English Language Learners (ELLs), are especially affected by the lack of practice. While automated feedback tools make it easier for teachers to assign more writing tasks, they are not designed with ELLs in mind. Existing tools are unable to provide feedback based on the language proficiency of the student, resulting in a final evaluation that may be skewed against the learner. Data science may be able to improve automated feedback tools to better support the unique needs of these learners.\n",

The essays have been scored according to six analytic measures: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions. Each measure represents a component of proficiency in essay writing, with greater scores corresponding to greater proficiency in that measure. The scores range from 1.0 to 5.0 in increments of 0.5. Your task is to predict the score of each of the six measures for the essays given in the test set.

      "Think you can use your data science skills to make big predictions at a submicroscopic level? Many diseases, including cancer, are believed to have a contributing factor in common. Ion channels are pore-forming proteins present in animals and plants. They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. If scientists could better study ion channels, which may be possible with the aid of machine learning, it could have a far-reaching impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "When ion channels open, they pass electric currents. Existing methods of detecting these state changes are slow and laborious. Humans must supervise the analysis, which imparts considerable bias, in addition to being tedious. These difficulties limit the volume of ion channel current analysis that can be used in research. Scientists hope that technology could enable rapid automatic detection of ion channel current events in raw data.  \n",
      "The University of Liverpool’s Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease is working to advance ion channel research. Their team of scientists have asked for your help. In this competition, you’ll use ion channel data to better model automatic identification methods. If successful, you’ll be able to detect individual ion channel events in noisy raw signals. The data is simulated and injected with real-world noise to emulate what scientists observe in laboratory experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology to analyze electrical data in cells has not changed significantly over the past 20 years. If we better understand ion channel activity, the research could impact many areas related to cell health and migration. From human diseases to how climate change affects plants, faster detection of ion channels could greatly accelerate solutions to major world problems.  \n",

      "- **Training Data**: Contains features similar to the Abalone dataset (e.g., physical measurements) and a target variable 'Rings'.\n",
      "- **Test Data**: Includes the same features as the training data but lacks the 'Rings' column, which we need to predict.\n",

      "- It is robust against overfitting especially when using many trees.\n",
      "- It works well with the numerical features present in this dataset.\n",

      "Description\n",
      "\n",
      "What do doctors do when a patient has trouble breathing? They use a ventilator to pump oxygen into a sedated patient's lungs via a tube in the windpipe. But mechanical ventilation is a clinician-intensive procedure, a limitation that was prominently on display during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators is prohibitively expensive, even before reaching clinical trials. High-quality simulators could reduce this barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current simulators are trained as an ensemble, where each model simulates a single lung setting. However, lungs and their attributes form a continuous space, so a parametric approach must be explored that would consider the differences in patient lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partnering with Princeton University, the team at Google Brain aims to grow the community around machine learning for mechanical ventilation control. They believe that neural networks and deep learning can better generalize across lungs with varying characteristics than the current industry standard of PID controllers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this competition, you’ll simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient's lung. The best submissions will take lung attributes compliance and resistance into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "If successful, you'll help overcome the cost barrier of developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators. This will pave the way for algorithms that adapt to patients and reduce the burden on clinicians during these novel times and beyond. As a result, ventilator treatments may become more widely available to help patients breathe.\n",

      "The goal of this competition is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine.

      "Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineIdentifier. HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for HasDetections for each machine in test.csv.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sampling methodology used to create this dataset was designed to meet certain business constraints, both in regards to user privacy as well as the time period during which the machine was running. Malware detection is inherently a time-series problem, but it is made complicated by the introduction of new machines, machines that come online and offline, machines that receive patches, machines that receive new operating systems, etc. While the dataset provided here has been roughly split by time, the complications and sampling requirements mentioned above may mean you may see imperfect agreement between your cross-validation, public, and private scores! Additionally, this dataset is not representative of Microsoft customers’ machines in the wild; it has been sampled to include a much larger proportion of malware machines.\n",

      "While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!\n",

Data scientists ― including Kaggle's very own Will Cukierski ― competed by the hundreds. Legends were made. (Will took 5th place, and eventually ended up working at Kaggle!)

      "Essay writing is an important method to evaluate student learning and performance. It is also time-consuming for educators to grade by hand. Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems can score essays to supplement an educator’s other efforts. AWEs also allow students to receive regular and timely feedback on their writing. However, due to their costs, many advancements in the field are not widely available to students and educators. Open-source solutions to assess student writing are needed to reach every community with these important educational tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous efforts to develop open-source AWEs have been limited by small datasets that were not nationally diverse or focused on common essay formats. The first Automated Essay Scoring competition scored student-written short-answer responses; however, this is a writing task not often used in the classroom. To improve upon earlier efforts, a more expansive dataset that includes high-quality, realistic classroom writing samples was required. Further, to broaden the impact, the dataset should include samples across economic and location populations to mitigate the potential of algorithmic bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this competition, you will work with the largest open-access writing dataset aligned to current standards for student-appropriate assessments. Can you help produce an open-source essay scoring algorithm that improves upon the original Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) competition hosted in 2012?\n",

      "Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting whether a claim will be made on an insurance policy. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features. Good luck and have fun! For ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n",

Patents are a form of intellectual property granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive vetting process prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity. \n",

The USPTO shares over 200 years' worth of human ingenuity with the world, from lightbulbs to quantum computers. Combined with creativity from the data science community, USPTO datasets carry unbounded potential to empower AI and ML models that will benefit the progress of science and society at large.”\n",

      "In this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims \"television set\" and a prior publication describes \"TV set\", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. \n",
      "\n",
      "This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a \"strong material\" and another uses \"steel\", that may also be a match. What counts as a \"strong material\" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn't want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations. \n",

      "In this dataset, you are presented pairs of phrases (an anchor and a target phrase) and asked to rate how similar they are on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical in meaning). This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent's context, specifically its CPC classification (version 2021.05), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases \"bird\" and \"Cape Cod\" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of \"house\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a code competition, in which you will submit code that will be run against an unseen test set. The unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs of phrases. A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes but is not used in scoring. \n",

      "Score meanings\n",
      "The scores are in the 0-1 range with increments of 0.25 with the following meanings:\n",
      "1.0 - Very close match. This is typically an exact match except possibly for differences in conjugation, quantity (e.g. singular vs. plural), and addition or removal of stopwords (e.g. “the”, “and”, “or”).\n",
      "0.75 - Close synonym, e.g. “mobile phone” vs. “cellphone”. This also includes abbreviations, e.g. \"TCP\" -> \"transmission control protocol\".\n",
      "0.5 - Synonyms which don’t have the same meaning (same function, same properties). This includes broad-narrow (hyponym) and narrow-broad (hypernym) matches.\n",
      "0.25 - Somewhat related, e.g. the two phrases are in the same high level domain but are not synonyms. This also includes antonyms.\n",
      "0.0 - Unrelated.\n",

      "Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new to their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n",

      "In 2015, Kaggle introduced Kernels as a resource to competition participants. It was a controversial decision to add a code-sharing tool to a competitive coding space. We thought it was important to make Kaggle more than a place where competitions are solved behind closed digital doors. Since then, Kernels has grown from its infancy—essentially a blinking cursor in a docker container—into its teenage years. We now have more compute, longer runtimes, better datasets, GPUs, and an improved interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have iterated and tested several Kernels-only (KO) competition formats with a true holdout test set, in particular deploying them when we would have otherwise substituted a two-stage competition. However, the experience of submitting to a Kernels-only competition has typically been asynchronous and imperfect; participants wait many days after a competition has concluded for their selected Kernels to be rerun on the holdout test dataset, the leaderboard updated, and the winners announced. This flow causes heartbreak to participants whose Kernels fail on the unseen test set, leaving them with no way to correct tiny errors that spoil months of hard work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Say Hello to Synchronous KO\n",
      "\n",
      "We're now pleased to announce general support for a synchronous Kernels-only format. When you submit from a Kernel, Kaggle will run the code against both the public test set and private test set in real time. This small-but-substantial tweak improves the experience for participants, the host, and Kaggle:\n",
      "\n",
      "- With a truly withheld test set, we are practicing proper, rigorous machine learning.\n",
      "- We will be able to offer more varieties of competitions and intend to run many fewer confusing two-stage competitions.\n",
      "- You will be able to see if your code runs successfully on the withheld test set and have the leeway to intervene if it fails.\n",
      "- We will run all submissions against the private data, not just selected ones.\n",
      "- Participants will get the complete and familiar public/private scores available in a traditional competition.\n",
      "- The final leaderboard can be released at the end of the competition, without the delay of rerunning Kernels.\n",
      "\n",
      "This competition is a low-stakes, trial-run introduction to our new synchronous KO implementation. We want to test that the process goes smoothly and gather feedback on your experiences. While it may feel like a normal KO competition, there are complicated new mechanics in play, such as the selection logic of Kernels that are still running when the deadline passes.\n",

In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n",

      "Computers are really good at answering questions with single, verifiable answers. But, humans are often still better at answering questions about opinions, recommendations, or personal experiences. Humans are better at addressing subjective questions that require a deeper, multidimensional understanding of context—something computers aren't trained to do well… yet. Questions can take many forms—some have multi-sentence elaborations, others may be simple curiosity or a fully developed problem. They can have multiple intents, or seek advice and opinions. Some may be helpful and others interesting. Some are simply right or wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it’s hard to build better subjective question-answering algorithms because of a lack of data and predictive models. That’s why the CrowdSource team at Google Research, a group dedicated to advancing NLP and other types of ML science via crowdsourcing, has collected data on a number of these quality scoring aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this competition, you’re challenged to use this new dataset to build predictive algorithms for different subjective aspects of question-answering. The question-answer pairs were gathered from nearly 70 different websites, in a \"common-sense\" fashion. Our raters received minimal guidance and training and relied largely on their subjective interpretation of the prompts. As such, each prompt was crafted in the most intuitive fashion so that raters could simply use their common sense to complete the task. By lessening our dependency on complicated and opaque rating guidelines, we hope to increase the re-use value of this dataset. What you see is what you get! Demonstrating these subjective labels can be predicted reliably can shine a new light on this research area. Results from this competition will inform the way future intelligent Q&A systems will get built, hopefully contributing to them becoming more human-like.\n",

The list of 30 target labels are the same as the column names in the `sample_submission.csv` file. Target labels with the prefix `question_` relate to the `question_title` and/or `question_body` features in the data. Target labels with the prefix `answer_` relate to the `answer` feature. Each row contains a single question and a single answer to that question, along with additional features. The training data contains rows with some duplicated questions (but with different answers). The test data does not contain any duplicated questions. This is not a binary prediction challenge. Target labels are aggregated from multiple raters, and can have continuous values in the range [0, 1]. Therefore, predictions must also be in that range. Since this is a synchronous re-run competition, you only have access to the Public test set. For planning purposes, the re-run test set is no larger than 10,000 rows and less than 8 Mb uncompressed. Additional information about the labels and collection method will be provided by the competition sponsor in the forum.\n",

Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries. You can collect other publicly available data to use in your model predictions, but in the spirit of this competition, use only data that would have been available before a movie's release.\n",

      "Note - many movies are remade over the years, therefore it may seem like multiple instances of a movie may appear in the data. However, they are different and should be considered separate movies. In addition, some movies may share a title but be entirely unrelated. E.g., The Karate Kid (id: 5266) was released in 1986, while a clearly (or maybe just subjectively) inferior remake (id: 1987) was released in 2010. Also, while the Frozen (id: 5295) released by Disney in 2013 may be the household name, don't forget about the less-popular Frozen (id: 139) released three years earlier about skiers who are stranded on a chairlift…\n",

These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams.

      "Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. The dataset used for this competition is synthetic but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. This dataset is based off of the original Forest Cover Type Prediction competition. Good luck and have fun! For ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n",

      "1. **Load the Data**: I'll load the training and test datasets to understand their structure and prepare them for modeling.\n",
      "2. **Data Preprocessing**: This includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.\n",
      "3. **Model Selection**: Given the task is a multi-class classification, I will use a robust classifier. A Random Forest classifier is a good choice for this kind of problem because it handles a large number of features well and is less likely to overfit compared to other algorithms.\n",
      "4. **Model Training**: Train the model using the training data.\n",
      "5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the `Cover_Type` for the test dataset.\n",
      "6. **Create Submission File**: Format the predictions to match the required submission format and save the file.\n",

Again, these will be fairly lightweight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n",

While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts.

      "Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n",
      "\n",
      "To start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Synthetically-Generated Datasets  \n",
      "Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n",

      "Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. Many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year with a few changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n",
      "\n",
      "With the great start and participation in January, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in February every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks instead. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n",
      "\n",
      "Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n",

      "Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!); we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n",
      "\n",
      "With the great start and participation in January, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in February every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks instead. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n",
      "\n",
      "Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n",

And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly lightweight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n",
      "\n",
      "To start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly lightweight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n",
      "Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n",

      "Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly lightweight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n",
      "\n",
      "To start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly lightweight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n",
      "\n",
      "Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation\n",

Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n",

Those questions are drawn from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",

While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between March 25 and April 22 by region, the primary goal isn't to produce accurate forecasts. It’s to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19. You are encouraged to pull in, curate, and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your findings in a notebook. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n",

What makes an issue urgent? What do citizens really care about? How much does location matter? Being able to predict the most pressing 311 topics will allow governments to focus their efforts on fixing the most important problems. The data set for the competitions contains several hundred thousand 311 issues from four cities.\n",

      "\n",
      "311 is a mechanism by which citizens can express their desire to solve a problem in the city or government by submitting a description of what needs to be done, fixed, or changed. In effect, this provides a high degree of transparency between government and its constituents. Once an issue has been established, citizens can vote and make comments on the issue so that government officials have some degree of awareness about what is the most important issue to address.\n",

When anyone in the community can report or comment on any issue, the entire group has a better perspective on what's happening—and how to fix it effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "For governments, SeeClickFix acts as a completely customizable CRM that plugs into your existing request management tools. From types of service requests to managing different watch areas, SeeClickFix helps better maintain and fulfill 311 requests in your city.\n",

      "Kaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenge to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 15 and May 14 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.\n",

      "As the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).\n",
      "\n",
      "We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n",

      "Companies and Organizations\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle’s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n",

All of the prior discussion forums have been migrated to this competition for continuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background  \n",
      "The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition of research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Challenge  \n",
      "Kaggle is launching companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19. You are encouraged to pull in, curate, and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your findings in a notebook. As the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies and Organizations  \n",
      "There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle’s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n",

      "Companies and Organizations  \n",
      "There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle’s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n",

      "This article contains the stepping function that is used for this competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obligatory Disclaimer: A lot has changed since the original competition was launched 6 years ago. With the change from \"exact starting point\" to \"any correct starting point\", it is possible to get a perfect score. We just don't know how difficult that will be. Use it as a fun learning experience, and don't spoil it for others by posting perfect solutions!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. The game consists of a board of cells that are either on or off. One creates an initial configuration of these on/off states and observes how it evolves. There are four simple rules to determine the next state of the game board, given the current state:\n",
      "- Overpopulation: If a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies.\n",
      "- Stasis: If a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives.\n",
      "- Underpopulation: If a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies.\n",
      "- Reproduction: If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it becomes a live cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "These simple rules result in many interesting behaviors and have been the focus of a large body of mathematics. As Wikipedia states:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ever since its publication, Conway's Game of Life has attracted much interest because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. Life provides an example of emergence and self-organization. It is interesting for computer scientists, physicists, biologists, biochemists, economists, mathematicians, philosophers, generative scientists, and others to observe the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of very simple rules. The game can also serve as a didactic analogy, used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that 'design' and 'organization' can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett has used the analogue of Conway's Life 'universe' extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as consciousness and free will, from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws governing our own universe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The emergence of order from simple rules begs an interesting question—what happens if we set time backwards?\n",
      "\n",
      "This competition is an experiment to see if machine learning (or optimization, or any method) can predict the game of life in reverse. Is the chaotic start of Life predictable from its orderly ends? We have created many games, evolved them, and provided only the end boards. You are asked to predict the starting board that resulted in each end board.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation \n",
      "You are evaluated on the mean absolute error of your predictions, stepped forward by the specified steps, and compared to the provided ending solution. In this case, this is equivalent to 1 − classification accuracy across all of the cells. You may only predict 0 (dead) or 1 (alive) for each cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Submission File \n",
      "For every game in the test set, your submission file should list the predicted starting board on a single row. Values are listed in a row-wise order. That is, if you want to predict a matrix:\n",
      "```\n",
      "1 2 3 4\n",
      "```\n",
      "the predicted row would be `(1,2,3,4)`. The submission file should contain a header and have the following format:\n",
      "```\n",
      "id, start_0, start_1, start_2, ..., start_624\n",

      "...\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Dataset Description \n",
      "We have provided 50,000 training games and 50,000 test games, whose starting board you must predict. Each board is 25x25, for a total of 625 cells per board. Values are listed in a row-wise order. You are free to create more training games if you desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided variables are:\n",
      "- id: unique identifier of each game\n",
      "- delta: the number of steps between the start and stop boards\n",
      "- start_0: row 1, column 1 of the game's starting board\n",
      "- start_1: row 1, column 2 of the game's starting board\n",
      "…\n",
      "- stop_0: row 1, column 1 of the game's stopping board\n",
      "…\n",
      "\n",
      "Your test-set predictions should be the starting board at delta steps before the stopping board. The games were created by the following procedure:\n",
      "1. An initial board was chosen by filling the board with a random density between 1% full (mostly zeros) and 99% full (mostly ones).\n",
      "2. This initial board was evolved 5 steps. The starting board's state was recorded after the 5 \"warmup steps\". These are the values in the start variables.\n",
      "3. The starting board was then evolved delta steps. Delta was chosen to be uniformly random between 1 and 5. If the stopping board was empty, the game was discarded. The stopping board's state was then recorded. These are the values in the stop variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs \n",
      "Why the need for warmup steps? The transition from an initial random board to the second step can be quite \"nonlinear\" and dramatic. For example, if a board is mostly alive at the first step, it will be mostly dead on the second. We allow the game to warm up for five steps in order to let the cells calm down and settle into a more \"life-like\" state.\n",

For example, many boards that are sparse at the start will end up in the same state (and you will see this in the data). However, over short time scales we expect this to be a minor issue. The largest step back in time in this competition is 5, which we hope is not so far that the degeneracy becomes an issue.\n",

      "The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

      "\n",
      "Currently, most educational texts are matched to readers using traditional readability methods or commercially available formulas. However, each has its issues. Tools like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level are based on weak proxies of text decoding (i.e., characters or syllables per word) and syntactic complexity (i.e., number of words per sentence). As a result, they lack construct and theoretical validity. At the same time, commercially available formulas, such as Lexile, can be cost-prohibitive, lack suitable validation studies, and suffer from transparency issues when the formula's features aren't publicly available.\n",

      "In this competition, you’ll build algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, you'll pair your machine learning skills with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains. Winning models will be sure to incorporate text cohesion and semantics.\n",
      "\n",
      "If successful, you'll aid administrators, teachers, and students. Literacy curriculum developers and teachers who choose passages will be able to quickly and accurately evaluate works for their classrooms. Plus, these formulas will become more accessible for all. Perhaps most importantly, students will benefit from feedback on the complexity and readability of their work, making it far easier to improve essential reading skills.\n",

Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed are explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.\n",

Utilizing a dataset of essays written by ELLs will help to develop proficiency models that better support all students. Your work will help ELLs receive more accurate feedback on their language development and expedite the grading cycle for teachers. These outcomes could enable ELLs to receive more appropriate learning tasks that will help them improve their English language proficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing is a foundational skill. Sadly, it's one few students are able to hone, often because writing tasks are infrequently assigned in school. A rapidly growing student population, students learning English as a second language, known as English Language Learners (ELLs), are especially affected by the lack of practice. While automated feedback tools make it easier for teachers to assign more writing tasks, they are not designed with ELLs in mind. Existing tools are unable to provide feedback based on the language proficiency of the student, resulting in a final evaluation that may be skewed against the learner. Data science may be able to improve automated feedback tools to better support the unique needs of these learners.\n",

It offers 70 undergraduate majors and a full range of graduate and professional degrees across 10 schools and colleges, all on a beautiful campus—an accredited arboretum—complete with athletic facilities and state-of-the-art laboratories. Vanderbilt is optimized to inspire and nurture cross-disciplinary research that fosters discoveries that have global impact. Vanderbilt and co-host, The Learning Agency Lab, an independent nonprofit based in Arizona, are focused on developing science of learning-based tools and programs for social good. Vanderbilt and The Learning Agency Lab have partnered together to offer data scientists the opportunity to support ELLs using data science skills in machine learning, natural language processing, and educational data analytics. You can improve automated feedback tools for ELLs by sensitizing them to language proficiency. The resulting tools could serve teachers by alleviating the grading burden and support ELLs by ensuring their work is evaluated within the context of their current language level.\n",

The essays have been scored according to six analytic measures: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions. Each measure represents a component of proficiency in essay writing, with greater scores corresponding to greater proficiency in that measure. The scores range from 1.0 to 5.0 in increments of 0.5. Your task is to predict the score of each of the six measures for the essays given in the test set.

      "Think you can use your data science skills to make big predictions at a submicroscopic level? Many diseases, including cancer, are believed to have a contributing factor in common. Ion channels are pore-forming proteins present in animals and plants. They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. If scientists could better study ion channels, which may be possible with the aid of machine learning, it could have a far-reaching impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "When ion channels open, they pass electric currents. Existing methods of detecting these state changes are slow and laborious. Humans must supervise the analysis, which imparts considerable bias, in addition to being tedious. These difficulties limit the volume of ion channel current analysis that can be used in research. Scientists hope that technology could enable rapid automatic detection of ion channel current events in raw data.  \n",
      "The University of Liverpool’s Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease is working to advance ion channel research. Their team of scientists have asked for your help. In this competition, you’ll use ion channel data to better model automatic identification methods. If successful, you’ll be able to detect individual ion channel events in noisy raw signals. The data is simulated and injected with real-world noise to emulate what scientists observe in laboratory experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology to analyze electrical data in cells has not changed significantly over the past 20 years. If we better understand ion channel activity, the research could impact many areas related to cell health and migration. From human diseases to how climate change affects plants, faster detection of ion channels could greatly accelerate solutions to major world problems.  \n",

      "What do doctors do when a patient has trouble breathing? They use a ventilator to pump oxygen into a sedated patient's lungs via a tube in the windpipe. But mechanical ventilation is a clinician-intensive procedure, a limitation that was prominently on display during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators is prohibitively expensive, even before reaching clinical trials. High-quality simulators could reduce this barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current simulators are trained as an ensemble, where each model simulates a single lung setting. However, lungs and their attributes form a continuous space, so a parametric approach must be explored that would consider the differences in patient lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partnering with Princeton University, the team at Google Brain aims to grow the community around machine learning for mechanical ventilation control. They believe that neural networks and deep learning can better generalize across lungs with varying characteristics than the current industry standard of PID controllers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this competition, you’ll simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient's lung. The best submissions will take lung attributes compliance and resistance into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "If successful, you'll help overcome the cost barrier of developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators. This will pave the way for algorithms that adapt to patients and reduce the burden on clinicians during these novel times and beyond. As a result, ventilator treatments may become more widely available to help patients breathe.\n",

As with their previous Malware Challenge (2015), Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences. Can you help protect more than one billion machines from damage BEFORE it happens?\n",

      "\n",
      "The goal of this competition is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineIdentifier. HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for HasDetections for each machine in test.csv.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sampling methodology used to create this dataset was designed to meet certain business constraints, both in regards to user privacy as well as the time period during which the machine was running. Malware detection is inherently a time-series problem, but it is made complicated by the introduction of new machines, machines that come online and offline, machines that receive patches, machines that receive new operating systems, etc. While the dataset provided here has been roughly split by time, the complications and sampling requirements mentioned above may mean you may see imperfect agreement between your cross-validation, public, and private scores! Additionally, this dataset is not representative of Microsoft customers’ machines in the wild; it has been sampled to include a much larger proportion of malware machines.\n",

      "Long ago, in the distant, fragrant mists of time, there was a competition… It was not just any competition. It was a competition that challenged mere mortals to model a 20,000x200 matrix of continuous variables using only 250 training samples… without overfitting. Data scientists ― including Kaggle's very own Will Cukierski ― competed by the hundreds. Legends were made. (Will took 5th place, and eventually ended up working at Kaggle!) People overfit like crazy. It was a Kaggle-y, data science-y madhouse. \n",

However, due to their costs, many advancements in the field are not widely available to students and educators. Open-source solutions to assess student writing are needed to reach every community with these important educational tools.\n",

The first Automated Essay Scoring competition scored student-written short-answer responses; however, this is a writing task not often used in the classroom. To improve upon earlier efforts, a more expansive dataset that includes high-quality, realistic classroom writing samples was required. Further, to broaden the impact, the dataset should include samples across economic and location populations to mitigate the potential of algorithmic bias.\n",

      "Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting whether a claim will be made on an insurance policy. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features. Good luck and have fun! For ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n",

      "In this dataset, you are presented pairs of phrases (an anchor and a target phrase) and asked to rate how similar they are on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical in meaning). This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent's context, specifically its CPC classification (version 2021.05), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases \"bird\" and \"Cape Cod\" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of \"house\".\n",

      "Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new to their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n",

However, the experience of submitting to a Kernels-only competition has typically been asynchronous and imperfect; participants wait many days after a competition has concluded for their selected Kernels to be rerun on the holdout test dataset, the leaderboard updated, and the winners announced. This flow causes heartbreak to participants whose Kernels fail on the unseen test set, leaving them with no way to correct tiny errors that spoil months of hard work.\n",

      "- We will run all submissions against the private data, not just selected ones.\n",

      "Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n",

      "Computers are really good at answering questions with single, verifiable answers. But, humans are often still better at answering questions about opinions, recommendations, or personal experiences. Humans are better at addressing subjective questions that require a deeper, multidimensional understanding of context—something computers aren't trained to do well… yet. Questions can take many forms—some have multi-sentence elaborations, others may be simple curiosity or a fully developed problem. They can have multiple intents, or seek advice and opinions. Some may be helpful and others interesting. Some are simply right or wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it’s hard to build better subjective question-answering algorithms because of a lack of data and predictive models. That’s why the CrowdSource team at Google Research, a group dedicated to advancing NLP and other types of ML science via crowdsourcing, has collected data on a number of these quality scoring aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this competition, you’re challenged to use this new dataset to build predictive algorithms for different subjective aspects of question-answering. The question-answer pairs were gathered from nearly 70 different websites, in a \"common-sense\" fashion. Our raters received minimal guidance and training and relied largely on their subjective interpretation of the prompts. As such, each prompt was crafted in the most intuitive fashion so that raters could simply use their common sense to complete the task. By lessening our dependency on complicated and opaque rating guidelines, we hope to increase the re-use value of this dataset. What you see is what you get! Demonstrating these subjective labels can be predicted reliably can shine a new light on this research area. Results from this competition will inform the way future intelligent Q&A systems will get built, hopefully contributing to them becoming more human-like.\n",

The list of 30 target labels are the same as the column names in the `sample_submission.csv` file. Target labels with the prefix `question_` relate to the `question_title` and/or `question_body` features in the data. Target labels with the prefix `answer_` relate to the `answer` feature. Each row contains a single question and a single answer to that question, along with additional features. The training data contains rows with some duplicated questions (but with different answers). The test data does not contain any duplicated questions. This is not a binary prediction challenge. Target labels are aggregated from multiple raters, and can have continuous values in the range [0, 1]. Therefore, predictions must also be in that range. Since this is a synchronous re-run competition, you only have access to the Public test set. For planning purposes, the re-run test set is no larger than 10,000 rows and less than 8 Mb uncompressed. Additional information about the labels and collection method will be provided by the competition sponsor in the forum.\n",

E.g., The Karate Kid (id: 5266) was released in 1986, while a clearly (or maybe just subjectively) inferior remake (id: 1987) was released in 2010.

      "Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. The dataset used for this competition is synthetic but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. This dataset is based off of the original Forest Cover Type Prediction competition. Good luck and have fun! For ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n",

      "Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly lightweight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n",
      "\n",
      "To start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly lightweight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n",
      "\n",
      "Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n",

Those questions are drawn from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",

While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between March 25 and April 22 by region, the primary goal isn't to produce accurate forecasts. It’s to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19. You are encouraged to pull in, curate, and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your findings in a notebook. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition of research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Challenge\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenge to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 15 and May 14 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are encouraged to pull in, curate, and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your findings in a notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).\n",
      "\n",
      "We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies and Organizations\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle’s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n",

      "- The grid size is larger (25 vs. 25) and the grid wraps around from top to bottom and left to right.\n",
      "- Submissions are solved forward by the appropriate number of steps so that any correct starting solution will achieve a maximum score.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article contains the stepping function that is used for this competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obligatory Disclaimer: A lot has changed since the original competition was launched 6 years ago. With the change from \"exact starting point\" to \"any correct starting point\", it is possible to get a perfect score. We just don't know how difficult that will be. Use it as a fun learning experience, and don't spoil it for others by posting perfect solutions!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. The game consists of a board of cells that are either on or off. One creates an initial configuration of these on/off states and observes how it evolves. There are four simple rules to determine the next state of the game board, given the current state:\n",
      "- Overpopulation: If a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies.\n",
      "- Stasis: If a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives.\n",
      "- Underpopulation: If a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies.\n",
      "- Reproduction: If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it becomes a live cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "These simple rules result in many interesting behaviors and have been the focus of a large body of mathematics. As Wikipedia states:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ever since its publication, Conway's Game of Life has attracted much interest because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. Life provides an example of emergence and self-organization. It is interesting for computer scientists, physicists, biologists, biochemists, economists, mathematicians, philosophers, generative scientists, and others to observe the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of very simple rules. The game can also serve as a didactic analogy, used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that 'design' and 'organization' can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett has used the analogue of Conway's Life 'universe' extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as consciousness and free will, from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws governing our own universe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The emergence of order from simple rules begs an interesting question—what happens if we set time backwards?\n",
      "\n",
      "This competition is an experiment to see if machine learning (or optimization, or any method) can predict the game of life in reverse. Is the chaotic start of Life predictable from its orderly ends? We have created many games, evolved them, and provided only the end boards. You are asked to predict the starting board that resulted in each end board.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation \n",
      "You are evaluated on the mean absolute error of your predictions, stepped forward by the specified steps, and compared to the provided ending solution. In this case, this is equivalent to 1 − classification accuracy across all of the cells. You may only predict 0 (dead) or 1 (alive) for each cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Submission File \n",
      "For every game in the test set, your submission file should list the predicted starting board on a single row. Values are listed in a row-wise order. That is, if you want to predict a matrix:\n",
      "```\n",
      "1 2 3 4\n",
      "```\n",
      "the predicted row would be `(1,2,3,4)`. The submission file should contain a header and have the following format:\n",
      "```\n",
      "id, start_0, start_1, start_2, ..., start_624\n",
      "50000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0\n",
      "50001, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0\n",
      "...\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Dataset Description \n",
      "We have provided 50,000 training games and 50,000 test games, whose starting board you must predict. Each board is 25x25, for a total of 625 cells per board. Values are listed in a row-wise order. You are free to create more training games if you desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided variables are:\n",
      "- id: unique identifier of each game\n",
      "- delta: the number of steps between the start and stop boards\n",
      "- start_0: row 1, column 1 of the game's starting board\n",
      "- start_1: row 1, column 2 of the game's starting board\n",
      "…\n",
      "- stop_0: row 1, column 1 of the game's stopping board\n",
      "…\n",
      "\n",
      "Your test-set predictions should be the starting board at delta steps before the stopping board. The games were created by the following procedure:\n",
      "1. An initial board was chosen by filling the board with a random density between 1% full (mostly zeros) and 99% full (mostly ones).\n",
      "2. This initial board was evolved 5 steps. The starting board's state was recorded after the 5 \"warmup steps\". These are the values in the start variables.\n",
      "3. The starting board was then evolved delta steps. Delta was chosen to be uniformly random between 1 and 5. If the stopping board was empty, the game was discarded. The stopping board's state was then recorded. These are the values in the stop variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs \n",
      "Why the need for warmup steps? The transition from an initial random board to the second step can be quite \"nonlinear\" and dramatic. For example, if a board is mostly alive at the first step, it will be mostly dead on the second. We allow the game to warm up for five steps in order to let the cells calm down and settle into a more \"life-like\" state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Game of Life loses information over time. What gives? Correct, this is a many-to-one problem (many starting states can lead to the same stopping state). For example, many boards that are sparse at the start will end up in the same state (and you will see this in the data). However, over short time scales we expect this to be a minor issue. The largest step back in time in this competition is 5, which we hope is not so far that the degeneracy becomes an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I predict any valid state? Yes. Any starting state that achieves the ending state will achieve an optimal score.\n",
